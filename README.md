This is a Windows repair tool — a simple utility that lets you execute useful commands for file repair or corruption checks using CHKDSK, SFC, DISM, and more.

It also includes functionality for cleaning temp files, resetting the network, clearing the DNS cache, and similar maintenance tasks.

While it's not a huge project, it can be useful for those who prefer not to type every command manually into CMD. With just a click of a button, it saves you time and effort.

Got ideas for a bigger project? Feel free to share them!

And while you're here — if you find this tool helpful, would you consider buying me a coffee? Every bit of support helps!
