This is a Windows repairer, a simple tool that allows you to excute useful commands for file repair or checking for any corruption in the disk like CHKDSK, SFC or DISM...
As well as some other functionalities like cleaning temp files, resetting the network, cleaning the DNS Cache, etc...
It's not that big of a project, but it might be useful for those who aren't interested in going and typing every command on the CMD, this is basically a shortcut, with a click of a button, it saves you time.

If you have any ideas for a bigger project, please don't hesitate to suggest them.

And while you're here, could you buy me a coffee? Every little bit counts.
